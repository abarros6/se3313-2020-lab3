SE3313 2020 Lab 3

in order to test the submission...

first!!!! if there are no output files present please run the make command to generate
the necessary files

open a terminal and run the server by entering ./Server

then open a new terminal (as many as you like) by entering ./Client

follow the prompts from the client and observe the output by the server as
well as the output from any of the clients in use

to gracefully termintate, for each client enter Done and send that message to the server
that should terminate the current client

once all the clients have been terminated, go to the server and enter Done
this should cause the server to gracefully terminate
